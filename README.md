# vignore

It is been a while that I hate to write ignore files, be it `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore` or `.fdignore`.

I failed to get the right files included, and failed to exclude unwanted files.

No more shooting in blind! Visualize your ignore files and get instant feedback in intuitive representation.
